# Game Logic
- the player has to click on "Correct" if he thinks it a right option or clicks on the "Wrong"
- every right choice give one point score and decrease one point in case the wrong choice 
- every word have only 5 choices (1 correct and 4 wrong)
- after every choice, the game shows the correct answer
- if he/she get -5 the game will end and show the game over
